Charakterystyka figue p≈Çaskich - Quick calculator-like program to compute moments of inertia for some popular figures: T I C L O

Eksperyment numeryczny - Numerical experiment, draws a graph that shows how Shear stress is related to Tensile stress. 
          Using randomly generated stress tensor, 2000 various cutting planes, and calculating for each plane tensile and shear stress
